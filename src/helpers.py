# I could fill every field with "." to make sure at least one card is generated
# with e.g.       note.fields = ["."] * len(note._model["flds"])
# this is save (and used by glutanimate's version of the note organizer add-on). But this means that I might
# have to manually delete a lot. This takes a least some seconds
# So it's probably quicker to wait for about five seconds so that Anki finds out
# the minimal amount of fields to fill
# start to empty existing fields:
#   note.fields = [""] * len(note._model["flds"])
# I can't just fill all the fields named in the first template because of conditional
# replacement.
# I can't randomly try out all combinations ...
# I have never read the code for card generation so it should take some time
# to extract the relevant code
# Instead use ugly workaround:
#    - get existing notes that generate a card 1
#    - narrow down to notes with the fewest cards generated
#    - narrow down to a note with the fewest fields filled
#    - only fill these fields
