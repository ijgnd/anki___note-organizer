<b>You should not use this add-on version if you are a regular anki user</b>. In its current form there's a good chance it'll permanently damage your collection (that holds everything you ever created or did in Anki).

The add-on was uploaded so that it's discoverable for people willing to take it over (fork it) or experienced users who want to test it and report bugs etc. I haven't really tested the add-on, especially not on newer Anki versions. Over the years some people told me that they sometimes use and their collection survived it. Use this at your own risk.

If you look for something that has a better chance of working maybe have a look at <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1114271285" rel="nofollow">Duplicate and Reorder</a> - the version from ankiweb from 2021-11-23 seemed to work well. 


This add-on allows to modify the creation time of notes and insert notes with a faked creation time.

The only persistent sorting criterion across reviews in Anki is the note creation time. By modifying this time artificially, the add-on allows you to define a custom note sorting order. This is different from all of the other repositioning tools Anki ships with because they only temporarily affect the order of introduction of new cards. Any changes performed to the positioning of new cards get lost once they enter the learning phase.
